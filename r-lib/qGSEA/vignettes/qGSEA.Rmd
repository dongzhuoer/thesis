```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(collapse = TRUE, comment = "#>")
```

This package aims to make preparing GSEA [^install] input files as easy as possible, by providing the following two methods:



# GUI by Shiny App 

```r
shiny::runApp(system.file('shiny/app.R', package = 'qGSEA'))
```

The app's usage should be pretty straightforward ^[You just need to click anywhere you like and it would show useful hint.], and there is a detailed [guide](https://bookdown.dongzhuoer.com/dongzhuoer/thesis/result.html#quick-run-GSEA) with screenshots.



# command line in R

   refer to `make_gsea_input()`.



[^install]:
    If you haven't install GSEA yet, here is a brief guide. 
    
    - go to [official download](http://software.broadinstitute.org/gsea/downloads.jsp)
    - download "javaGSEA Java Jar file" under `Software` tab
    - download gene set collections (`.gmt` file) you want to analyse under `MSigDB` tab (choose `h.all.v6.1.symbols.gmt` if you get confused.
