GSE49577	ovarian	101	Chemotherapy induced dynamic gene expression changes in vivo are prognostic in ovarian cancer	Carboplatin and paclitaxel are the most widely prescribed chemotherapeutic agents for ovarian cancer. Not all patients respond to treatment, so there is a need for biomarkers that reliably predict resistance in ovarian tumors. Expression of such biomarkers may be dynamically controlled. Gene expression was assessed for a period of 14 days after treatment with carboplatin or combined carboplatin-paclitaxel in xenografts from two ovarian cancer models: chemosensitive serous adenocarcinoma derived OV1002 and slow growing, chemoresistant HOX424 of clear cell origin. more...
GSE36693	breast	101	Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase UBASH3B is Overexpressed in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer and Promotes Invasion and Metastasis	Efforts to improve the clinical outcome of highly aggressive triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) have been hindered by the lack of effective targeted therapies. Thus, it is important to identify the specific gene targets/pathways driving the invasive phenotype to develop more effective therapeutics. Here we show that ubiquitin-associated and SH3 domain-containing B (UBASH3B), a protein tyrosine phosphatase, is overexpressed in TNBC, where it supports malignant growth, invasion, and metastasis largely through modulating epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). more...
GSE46141	breast	91	Expression data from fine-needle aspiration biopsies of breast cancer metastases from different anatomical sites	Breast cancer molecular subtypes preferentially metastasize to specific organs and the anatomical location of the metastasis is associated with the length of survival post-recurrence.

GSE40206	breast	80	Differential expression of genes and protein networks in the primary breast tumor that proceed to distant metastasis	The presence or absence of lymph node metastasis plays a major role in the prediction of prognosis and subsequent patient management. However, good proportion of patients who display lymph node positivity remain disease free for 3 years or more, after the initial treatment, while a third of those who were lymph node negative at presentation, develop distant metastasis within the same period. We performed gene expression profiling on a cohort Indian breast cancer patients  followed up for a period of 3-5 years and in comparison with a previously published Caucasian cohort data, we identified gene signatures that are associated with distant metastasis. more...
GSE31364	breast	72	A gene expression profile that predicts circulating tumor cell presence in breast cancer patients	Development of a primary tumor gene expression profile that can predict the presence of circulating tumor cells in the blood of breast cancer patients. The detection of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in the peripheral blood and microarray gene expression profiling of the primary tumor are two promising new technologies able to provide valuable prognostic data for patients with breast cancer. In the current study, we aimed to develop a novel profile which provided independent prognostic data by building a signature predictive of CTC status rather than outcome.
GSE55470	breast	67	Gene expression profiling of circulating tumor cells in breast cancer	CTCs are the purpoted intermediates of metastatic dissemination and are likely to contain cellular clones responsible for disease progression representing a preferred source for identification of druggable targets. Unfortunately a molecular characterization of CTCs is seriously hampered by their low numbers even in metastatic patients and by the elevated contamination of isolated CTCs with leukocytes. more...

GSE55348	breast	53	Gene expression profiling of primary HER2-positive breast cancers treated with adjuvant trastuzumab	Trastuzumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody directed to the HER2 protein, is the standard-of-care treatment for patients with HER2 positive breast cancer, reducing the risk of relapse and death in patients. Nonetheless, some patients relapse after treatment, underscoring the need to identify patients for whom chemotherapy + trastuzumab is adequate versus patients requiring additional drugs. To search for genes predictive of relapse in HER2-positive breast carcinoma patients treated with adjuvant trastuzumab, we conducted gene expression profiling analysis in 53 cases treated in the clinic with doxorubicin/paclitaxel (AT) followed by cyclophosphamide/methotrexate/fluorouracil (CMF) and trastuzumab.

GSE36586	breast	14	Interplay between AP-1 and ERalpha in regulating gene expression and proliferation networks in breast cancer cells	Estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) is a ligand-dependent transcription factor that plays an important role in breast cancer. Estrogen-dependent gene regulation by ERalpha can be mediated by interaction with other DNA-binding proteins, such as activator protein-1 (AP-1). The nature of such interactions in mediating the estrogen response in breast cancer cells remains unclear. Here we show that knockdown of c-Fos, a component of the transcription factor AP-1, attenuates the expression of 37% of all estrogen-regulated genes, suggesting that AP-1 is a fundamental factor for ERalpha-mediated transcription. more...

We have previously shown that TGF-beta has tumor suppressor activity in the MCF10Ca1h (M3) human breast cancer xenograft model.  To identify potential molecular players in the tumor suppressor responses,  we performed global gene expression analyses. To determine which genes were regulated by TGF-beta in this tumor model in vivo,  we performed gene expression arrays on tumors derived from xenografts of M3 cells with and without expression of a dominant negative TGF-beta receptor to block activity of endogenous TGF-beta.
