abstract = {The Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) project was initiated in response to the growing demand for a public repository for high-throughput gene expression data. GEO provides a flexible and open design that facilitates submission, storage and retrieval of heterogeneous data sets from high-throughput gene expression and genomic hybridization experiments. GEO is not intended to replace in house gene expression databases that benefit from coherent data sets, and which are constructed to facilitate a particular analytic method, but rather complement these by acting as a tertiary, central data distribution hub. The three central data entities of GEO are platforms, samples and series, and were designed with gene expression and genomic hybridization experiments in mind. A platform is, essentially, a list of probes that define what set of molecules may be detected. A sample describes the set of molecules that are being probed and references a single platform used to generate its molecular abundance data. A series organizes samples into the meaningful data sets which make up an experiment. The GEO repository is publicly accessible through the World Wide Web at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo.},

The resulting Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs) were a gold mine of novel gene sequences that provided an infrastructure for additional large-scale projects, such as gene maps, expression systems, and full-length cDNA projects. In addition, untold numbers of targeted gene-hunting projects have benefited from the availability of these sequences and the physical clone reagents. However, the high level of redundancy found among transcribed sequences, not to mention a variety of common experimental artifacts, made it difficult for many people to make effective use of the data. This problem was the motivation for the development of UniGene, a largely automated analytical system for producing an organized view of the transcriptome. In this chapter, we discuss the properties of the input sequences, the process by which they are analyzed in UniGene, and some pointers on how to use the resource.},

abstract = {High-density marker panels and/or whole-genome sequencing, coupled with advanced phenotyping pipelines and sophisticated statistical methods, have dramatically increased our ability to generate lists of candidate genes or regions that are putatively associated with phenotypes or processes of interest. However, the speed with which we can validate genes, or even make reasonable biological interpretations about the principles underlying them, has not kept pace. A promising approach that runs parallel to explicitly validating individual genes is analyzing a set of genes together and assessing the biological similarities among them. This is often achieved via gene ontology analysis, a powerful tool that involves evaluating publicly available gene annotations. However, additional resources such as Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) can also be used to evaluate sets of genes to make biological interpretations. In this manuscript, we describe utilizing MeSH terms to make biological interpretations in maize. MeSH terms are assigned to PubMed-indexed manuscripts by the National Library of Medicine, and can be directly mapped to genes to develop gene annotations. Once mapped, these terms can be evaluated for enrichment in sets of genes or similarity between gene sets to provide biological insights. Here, we implement MeSH analyses in five maize datasets to demonstrate how MeSH can be leveraged by the maize and broader crop-genomics community. We demonstrate that MeSH terms can be effectively leveraged to generate hypotheses and make biological interpretations in maize, and we provide a pipeline that enables the use of MeSH terms in other plant species.},

A common statistical approach is to quantify the interest of each gene with a p-value, adjust these p-values for multiple comparisons, choose an appropriate cut-off, and create a list of candidate genes. This approach has been criticised for ignoring biological knowledge regarding how genes work together. Recently a series of methods, that do incorporate biological knowledge, have been proposed. However, the most popular method, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), seems overly complicated. Furthermore, GSEA is based on a statistical test known for its lack of sensitivity. In this article we compare the performance of a simple alternative to GSEA. We find that this simple solution clearly outperforms GSEA. We demonstrate this with eight different microarray datasets.},

@article{subtle-expr-change,
abstract = {MOTIVATION: Analysis of large-scale expression data is greatly facilitated by the availability of gene ontologies (GOs). Many current methods test whether sets of transcripts annotated with specific ontology terms contain an excess of 'changed' transcripts. This approach suffers from two main limitations. First, since gene expression is continuous rather than discrete, designating a gene as changed or unchanged is arbitrary and oblivious to the actual magnitude of the change. Second, by considering only the number of changed genes, finer changes in expression patterns associated with the category may be ignored. Since genes generally participate in multiple networks, widespread and subtle modifications in expression patterns are at least as important as extreme increases/decreases of a few genes. RESULTS: Numerical simulations confirm that incorporating continuous measures of gene expression for all measured transcripts yields detection of considerably more subtle changes. Applying continuous measures to microarray data from brains of mice injected with the Parkinsonian neurotoxin, MPTP, enables detection of changes in various biologically relevant GO terms, many of which are overlooked by discrete approaches.},

Tools performing such analyses are often restricted to a category score based on a cutoff in the ranked list and a significance calculation based on random gene permutations as null hypothesis.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We analysed three publicly available data sets, in each of which samples were divided in two classes and genes ranked according to their correlation to class labels. We developed a program, Catmap (available for download at http://bioinfo.thep.lu.se/Catmap), to compare different scores and null hypotheses in gene category analysis, using Gene Ontology annotations for category definition. When a cutoff-based score was used, results depended strongly on the choice of cutoff, introducing an arbitrariness in the analysis. Comparing results using random gene permutations and random sample permutations, respectively, we found that the assigned significance of a category depended strongly on the choice of null hypothesis. Compared to sample label permutations, gene permutations gave much smaller p-values for large categories with many coexpressed genes.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: In gene category analyses of ranked gene lists, a cutoff independent score is preferable. The choice of null hypothesis is very important; random gene permutations does not work well as an approximation to sample label permutations.},

@article{threshold-affect-conclusion,
abstract = {Global analysis of gene expression by using DNA microarrays is employed increasingly to search for differences in biological properties between normal and diseased tissue. In such studies, expression that deviates from defined thresholds commonly is used for creating genetic signatures that characterize disease vs. normality. Although it is axiomatic that the threshold parameters applied to microarray analysis will alter the contents of such genetic signatures, the extent to which threshold choice can affect the fundamental conclusions made from microarray-based studies has not been elucidated. We used GABRIEL (Genetic Analysis By Rules Incorporating Expert Logic), a platform of knowledge-based algorithms for the global analysis of gene expression, together with conventional statistical approaches, to examine the sensitivity of conclusions to threshold choice in recently published microarray-based studies. An analysis of the effects of threshold decisions in one of these studies [Ramaswamy, S., Ross, K. N., Lander, E. S. {\&} Golub, T. R. (2003) Nat. Genet. 33, 49-54], which arrived at the important conclusion that the metastatic potential of primary tumors is encoded by the bulk of cells in the tumor, is the focus of this article. We discovered that support for this conclusion highly depends on the threshold used to create gene expression signatures. We also found that threshold choice dramatically affected the gene function categories represented nonrandomly in signatures. Our results suggest that the robustness of biological conclusions made by using microarray analysis should be routinely assessed by examining the validity of the conclusions by using a range of threshold parameters.},

@article{GSEA,
abstract = {Although genomewide RNA expression analysis has become a routine tool in biomedical research, extracting biological insight from such information remains a major challenge. Here, we describe a powerful analytical method called Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) for interpreting gene expression data. The method derives its power by focusing on gene sets, that is, groups of genes that share common biological function, chromosomal location, or regulation. We demonstrate how GSEA yields insights into several cancer-related data sets, including leukemia and lung cancer. Notably, where single-gene analysis finds little similarity between two independent studies of patient survival in lung cancer, GSEA reveals many biological pathways in common. The GSEA method is embodied in a freely available software package, together with an initial database of 1,325 biologically defined gene sets.},

The algorithm is explained in detail and its performance is compared to that of other methods using objective benchmarking criteria. Furthermore, we explore how sample source bias can affect the results of a GSEA analysis. The benchmarking results show that SetRank is a highly specific tool for GSEA.

SeqGSEA implements an analysis pipeline, which first computes differential splicing and differential expression scores, followed by integrating them into a per-gene score that quantifies each gene's association with a phenotype of interest, and finally executes gene set enrichment analysis in a cutoff-free manner to achieve biological insights. SeqGSEA accounts for biological variability and determines the statistical significance of gene pathways and networks using subject permutation, and thus requires at least five samples per group. Real applications show that SeqGSEA detects more biologically meaningful gene sets without biases toward long or highly expressed genes. SeqGSEA can be set up to run in parallel to reduce the analysis time.

@article{DSGSeq,
abstract = {Recent study revealed that most human genes have alternative splicing and can produce multiple isoforms of transcripts. Differences in the relative abundance of the isoforms of a gene can have significant biological consequences. Identifying genes that are differentially spliced between two groups of RNA-sequencing samples is an important basic task in the study of transcriptomes with next-generation sequencing technology. We use the negative binomial (NB) distribution to model sequencing reads on exons, and propose a NB-statistic to detect differentially spliced genes between two groups of samples by comparing read counts on all exons. The method opens a new exon-based approach instead of isoform-based approach for the task. It does not require information about isoform composition, nor need the estimation of isoform expression. Experiments on simulated data and real RNA-seq data of human kidney and liver samples illustrated the method's good performance and applicability. It can also detect previously unknown alternative splicing events, and highlight exons that are most likely differentially spliced between the compared samples. We developed an NB-statistic method that can detect differentially spliced genes between two groups of samples without using a prior knowledge on the annotation of alternative splicing. It does not need to infer isoform structure or to estimate isoform expression. It is a useful method designed for comparing two groups of RNA-seq samples. Besides identifying differentially spliced genes, the method can highlight on the exons that contribute the most to the differential splicing.

The resulting GSEA-SNP method rests on the assumption that SNPs underlying a disease phenotype are enriched in genes constituting a signaling pathway or those with a common regulation. Besides improving power for association mapping, GSEA-SNP may facilitate the identification of disease-associated SNPs and pathways, as well as the understanding of the underlying biological mechanisms. GSEA-SNP may also help to identify markers with weak effects, undetectable in association studies without pathway consideration.

@article{SAM-GS,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Gene-set analysis evaluates the expression of biological pathways, or a priori defined gene sets, rather than that of individual genes, in association with a binary phenotype, and is of great biologic interest in many DNA microarray studies. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) has been applied widely as a tool for gene-set analyses. We describe here some critical problems with GSEA and propose an alternative method by extending the individual-gene analysis method, Significance Analysis of Microarray (SAM), to gene-set analyses (SAM-GS). RESULTS: Using a mouse microarray dataset with simulated gene sets, we illustrate that GSEA gives statistical significance to gene sets that have no gene associated with the phenotype (null gene sets), and has very low power to detect gene sets in which half the genes are moderately or strongly associated with the phenotype (truly-associated gene sets). SAM-GS, on the other hand, performs very well. The two methods are also compared in the analyses of three real microarray datasets and relevant pathways, the diverging results of which clearly show advantages of SAM-GS over GSEA, both statistically and biologically. In a microarray study for identifying biological pathways whose gene expressions are associated with p53 mutation in cancer cell lines, we found biologically relevant performance differences between the two methods. Specifically, there are 31 additional pathways identified as significant by SAM-GS over GSEA, that are associated with the presence vs. absence of p53. Of the 31 gene sets, 11 actually involve p53 directly as a member. A further 6 gene sets directly involve the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis pathways, 3 involve the cell-cycle machinery, and 3 involve cytokines and/or JAK/STAT signaling. Each of these 12 gene sets, then, is in a direct, well-established relationship with aspects of p53 signaling. Of the remaining 8 gene sets, 6 have plausible, if less well established, links with p53. CONCLUSION: We conclude that GSEA has important limitations as a gene-set analysis approach for microarray experiments for identifying biological pathways associated with a binary phenotype. As an alternative statistically-sound method, we propose SAM-GS. A free Excel Add-In for performing SAM-GS is available for public use.},

GSEA is especially useful when gene expression changes in a given microarray data set is minimal or moderate. RESULTS We developed a modified gene set enrichment analysis method based on a parametric statistical analysis model. Compared with GSEA, the parametric analysis of gene set enrichment (PAGE) detected a larger number of significantly altered gene sets and their p-values were lower than the corresponding p-values calculated by GSEA. Because PAGE uses normal distribution for statistical inference, it requires less computation than GSEA, which needs repeated computation of the permutated data set. PAGE was able to detect significantly changed gene sets from microarray data irrespective of different Affymetrix probe level analysis methods or different microarray platforms. Comparison of two aged muscle microarray data sets at gene set level using PAGE revealed common biological themes better than comparison at individual gene level. CONCLUSION PAGE was statistically more sensitive and required much less computational effort than GSEA, it could identify significantly changed biological themes from microarray data irrespective of analysis methods or microarray platforms, and it was useful in comparison of multiple microarray data sets.

We have solved the solution NMR structure of the constant region of human LAP2 (residues 1-168). Human LAP2(1-168) has two structurally independent, non-interacting domains located at residues 1-50 ('LAP2-N') and residues 111-152 (LEM-domain), connected by an approximately 60-residue flexible linker. The two domains are structurally homologous, comprising a helical turn followed by two helices connected by an 11-12-residue loop. This motif is shared by subdomains of T4 endonuclease VII and transcription factor rho, despite negligible ({\textless} or =15{\%}) sequence identity. NMR chemical shift mapping demonstrated that the LEM-domain binds BAF (barrier-to-autointegration factor), whereas LAP2-N binds DNA. Both binding surfaces comprise helix 1, the N-terminus of helix 2 and the inter-helical loop. Binding selectivity is determined by the nature of the surface residues in these binding sites, which are predominantly positively charged for LAP2-N and hydrophobic for the LEM-domain. Thus, LEM and LEM-like motifs form a common structure that evolution has customized for binding to BAF or DNA.},

In this article we present biophysical and structural studies on a complex of BAF(2) and Em(LEM). Light scattering, analytical ultracentrifugation, and NMR indicate a stoichiometry of one molecule of Em(LEM) bound per BAF(2) dimer. The equilibrium dissociation constant (K(d)) for the interaction of the BAF(2) dimer and Em(LEM), determined by isothermal titration calorimetry, is 0.59 +/- 0.03 microm. Z-exchange spectroscopy between corresponding cross-peaks of the magnetically non-equivalent subunits of the BAF(2) dimer in the complex yields a dissociation rate constant of 78 +/- 2s(-1). The solution NMR structure of the BAF(2)-Em(LEM) complex reveals that the LEM and DNA binding sites on BAF(2) are non-overlapping and that both subunits of the BAF(2) dimer contribute approximately equally to the Em(LEM) binding site. The relevance of the implications of the structural and biophysical data on the complex in the context of the interaction between the BAF(2) dimer and Em(LEM) at the nuclear envelope is discussed.},

Each ankyrin repeat exhibits a helix?turn?helix conformation, and strings of such tandem repeats are packed in a nearly linear array to form helix?turn?helix bundles with relatively flexible loops. The global structure of an ankyrin repeat protein is mainly stabilized by intra- and inter-repeat hydrophobic and hydrogen bonding interactions. The repetitive and elongated nature of ankyrin repeat proteins provides the molecular bases of the unique characteristics of ankyrin repeat proteins in protein stability, folding and unfolding, and binding specificity. Recent studies have demonstrated that ankyrin repeat proteins do not recognize specific sequences, and interacting residues are discontinuously dispersed into the whole molecules of both the ankyrin repeat protein and its partner. In addition, the availability of thousands of ankyrin repeat sequences has made it feasible to use rational design to modify the specificity and stability of physiologically important ankyrin repeat proteins and even to generate ankyrin repeat proteins with novel functions through combinatorial chemistry approaches.},

@article{LEM-localization,
abstract = {Proteins resident in the inner nuclear membrane and underlying nuclear lamina form a network that regulates nuclear functions. This review highlights a prominent family of nuclear lamina proteins that carries the LAP2-emerin-MAN1-domain (LEM-D). LEM-D proteins share an ability to bind lamins and tether repressive chromatin at the nuclear periphery. The importance of this family is underscored by findings that loss of individual LEM-D proteins causes progressive, tissue-restricted diseases, known as laminopathies. Diverse functions of LEM-D proteins are linked to interactions with unique and overlapping partners including signal transduction effectors, transcription factors and architectural proteins. Recent investigations suggest that LEM-D proteins form hubs within the nuclear lamina that integrate external signals important for tissue homeostasis and maintenance of progenitor cell populations.},

@article{LEM-coordinate-kinase-phosphatase,
abstract = {Mitosis in metazoa requires nuclear envelope (NE) disassembly and reassembly. NE disassembly is driven by multiple phosphorylation events. Mitotic phosphorylation of the protein BAF reduces its affinity for chromatin and the LEM family of inner nuclear membrane proteins; loss of this BAF-mediated chromatin-NE link contributes to NE disassembly. BAF must reassociate with chromatin and LEM proteins at mitotic exit to reform the NE; however, how its dephosphorylation is regulated is unknown. Here, we show that the C. elegans protein LEM-4L and its human ortholog Lem4 (also called ANKLE2) are both required for BAF dephosphorylation. They act in part by inhibiting BAF's mitotic kinase, VRK-1, in vivo and in vitro. In addition, Lem4/LEM-4L interacts with PP2A and is required for it to dephosphorylate BAF during mitotic exit. By coordinating VRK-1- and PP2A-mediated signaling on BAF, Lem4/LEM-4L controls postmitotic NE formation in a function conserved from worms to humans. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

@article{LEM-N-hydrophobic-anchor,
abstract = {The human LEM-domain protein family is involved in fundamental aspects of nuclear biology. The LEM-domain interacts with the barrier-to-autointegration factor (BAF), which itself binds DNA. LEM-domain proteins LAP2, emerin and MAN1 are proteins of the inner nuclear membrane; they have important functions: maintaining the integrity of the nuclear lamina and regulating gene expression at the nuclear periphery.LEM4/ANKLE-2 has been proposed to participate in nuclear envelope reassembly after mitosis and to mediate dephosphorylation of BAF through binding to phosphatase PP2A. Here, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to create several cell lines deficient in LEM4/ANKLE-2. By using time-lapse video microscopy, we show that absence of this protein severely compromises the post mitotic re-association of the nuclear proteins BAF, LAP2$\alpha$ and LaminA to chromosomes. These defects give rise to a strong mechanical instability of the nuclear envelope in telophase and to a chromosomal instability leading to increased number of hyperploid cells. Reintroducing LEM4/ANKLE-2 in the cells by transfection could efficiently restore the telophase association of BAF and LAP2$\alpha$ to the chromosomes. This rescue phenotype was abolished for N- or C-terminally truncated mutants that had lost the capacity to bind PP2A. We demonstrate also that, in addition to binding to PP2A, LEM4/ANKLE-2 binds BAF through its LEM-domain, providing further evidence for a generic function of this domain as a principal interactor of BAF.},

@article{chr12q24-amplicon,
abstract = {A single cancer cell contains large numbers of genetic alterations that in combination create the malignant phenotype. However, whether amplified and mutated genes form functional and physical interaction networks that could explain the selection for cells with combined alterations is unknown. To investigate this issue, we characterized copy number alterations in 191 breast tumors using dense single nucleotide polymorphism arrays and identified 1,747 genes with copy number gain organized into 30 amplicons. Amplicons were distributed unequally throughout the genome. Each amplicon had distinct enrichment pattern in pathways, networks, and molecular functions, but genes within individual amplicons did not form coherent functional units. Genes in amplicons included all major tumorigenic pathways and were highly enriched in breast cancer-causative genes. In contrast, 1,188 genes with somatic mutations in breast cancer were distributed randomly over the genome, did not represent a functionally cohesive gene set, and were relatively less enriched in breast cancer marker genes. Mutated and gained genes did not show statistically significant overlap but were highly synergistic in populating key tumorigenic pathways including transforming growth factor beta, WNT, fibroblast growth factor, and PIP3 signaling. In general, mutated genes were more frequently upstream of gained genes in transcription regulation signaling than vice versa, suggesting that mutated genes are mainly regulators, whereas gained genes are mostly regulated. ESR1 was the major transcription factor regulating amplified but not mutated genes. Our results support the hypothesis that multiple genetic events, including copy number gains and somatic mutations, are necessary for establishing the malignant cell phenotype.},
